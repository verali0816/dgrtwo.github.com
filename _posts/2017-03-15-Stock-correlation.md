We want to develop a script to scrape the information for the stock prices from Yahoo Finance for the years 2008-2017. Consequently, we would like to format the dataset to include the information of the change of annual returns of every stock by looking at initial and closing stock price. Then, we will proceed to calculate the correlation matrix for the 500 stocks and use some clustering method prior to visualizing it into a possible network. A possible objective would be to compare the different clusters/patterns over time.
